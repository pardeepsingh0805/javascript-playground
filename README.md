# Javascript Playground

Hello Everyone this is my javascript playground, I have created some fun components and examples have fun.

### 1. Progress Tracker:

The progress tracker is a simple component that displays a progress bar based on the number of steps provided by the user. It's a great way to let user know how much progress they have made.
You can tweak the element in the html file to change the progress bar.
